### Feedback

- Hard to grasp at first
- Desire for an undo button
- Fun to play
- Turn-based was not obvious
- Input felt blocky (stuttery maybe?)

### Retrospective

- Mike was kind of a dick and blew up at everyone, need to remember this is for fun and not to let external stress bleed into the jam
- Scope seemed too big for the timeframe because core game was not completed until final day
- Didn't have as many features as we originally wanted
- Some puzzles were really well done, others were thrown together
- Really cool drawing that made a sudo-3d effect
- Tutorial was there, but a little rough
